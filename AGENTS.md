# pi-codex-goal — agent notes

Pi extension: Codex-style `/goal` command and `get_goal` / `create_goal` / `update_goal` tools. State lives in pi session custom entries.

## Local pi install policy

On this machine, the canonical active install is the global/user package pointing at this local checkout:

```text
../../Projects/AI/pi-codex-goal
```

Do not leave project-local installs of this package in this repo. In particular, avoid release verification commands such as:

```sh
pi install -l npm:pi-codex-goal
pi install -l https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-codex-goal@vX.Y.Z
```

Those write duplicate package entries under `.pi/` for the current project, causing `get_goal`, `create_goal`, and `update_goal` tool-registration conflicts with the global local-checkout install. For install-path release verification, use an isolated temp project/config directory or remove the project-local entries immediately after the check. With Pi 0.79+ project trust, pass `--approve` for isolated project-local package install/list/non-interactive smoke commands when those commands must load `.pi/settings.json`. If conflicts appear, inspect `pi list --approve` and `.pi/settings.json`, then remove any project-local `pi-codex-goal` npm/GitHub installs so only the global local-checkout package remains active.

## Verify before finishing

```sh
npm run verify
```

Runs `tsc --noEmit`, the platform-smoke harness checks, and the full Node test suite (`test/*.test.ts`).

For release-sensitive changes, also use the local Crabbox platform gate documented in `docs/platform-smoke.md`:

```sh
npm run check:platform-smoke
npm run smoke:platform:all
```

`smoke:platform:all` runs `smoke:platform:doctor` before any target suite starts.

The required gate runs the full suite plus a real model-backed goal-tool smoke on macOS, Ubuntu Linux, and native Windows. The default smoke model is `zai/glm-5.2`; override with `PLATFORM_SMOKE_MODEL` when needed.
